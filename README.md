<h1>Advanced Modeling and Cross Validation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of predicting the selling price of homes based on 40 total recorded features of a house. Building upon the foundations laid in the previous project titled "Modeling and Testing," a rigorous analysis is initiated by employing the Cross-validation technique, leveraging a 200-case holdout sample. This initial phase is crucial for evaluating the efficacy of the original model. Subsequently, more advanced models are created utlizing metrics such as R-squared and AIC slection methods. The refinement of these models involves a strategic removal of outliers from the dataset, aimed at achieving a more accurate representation of the underlying patterns in the data. To validate the performance of the newly crafted models, the same 200-case holdout sample is employed for a rigorous Cross-validation technique. Cross-correlation calculations, residuals evaluations, shrinkage assessments, and the genderation of plots contribute to the analysis of the model's performance and ability to effectively predict housing prices.
